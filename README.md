# University of Helsinki's Java Programming Course (MOOC) - 2023 Solutions

Welcome to the repository for my solutions to the University of Helsinki's Java Programming Course (MOOC) for the year 2023.

## Purpose

My primary objective with this repository is to assist fellow students on their learning journey. As a learner myself, I believe that one of the best ways to understand a programming language is to study and discuss solutions collaboratively. Learning Java and programming can be challenging, and my solutions are here to provide guidance and insights for both you and me.

## What to Expect

- **Solutions:** You will find well-documented Java code solutions for the exercises in the course.

- **Comments:** I've included comments throughout the code to explain the thought process behind each solution. These comments should help you understand not only the "how" but also the "why" of each piece of code.

## How to Use This Repository

Feel free to explore the solutions and code comments for the specific exercises you're interested in. Use these as a resource to deepen your understanding of Java programming concepts.

## Contributing

I welcome contributions and improvements from the community. If you have a different approach to solving an exercise or wish to add clarity to existing comments, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

Happy coding and learning!
